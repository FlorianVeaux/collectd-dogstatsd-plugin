## Each element of `plugins` can contain those fields:
##  - plugin_instance: the plugin_instance of each metric will be used as a tag with the key you defined.
##  - type_instance: the type_instance of each metric will be used as a tag with the key you defined.
##  - values_to_tags: when a collectd `value` has multiple values. Each one is submitted with the tags you defined.
##  - values_to_suffix: same but a suffix is appended to the metric name instead of a tag.
##  - aliases: map from string to string, used to give a better name to metrics. The key is the metric `type`
